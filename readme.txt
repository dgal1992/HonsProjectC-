This project was designed to merge two different database vendors to work in cohesion with each other. 

Visual Studio acted as a platform to develop a hybrid database application.

No design techniques are used for the interface of this development. 

This application is based on local databases and does not perform without either of the databases being connected. 

This project was created for academic purposes only.
